    <h2>What is Cascading?</h2>
    <p>
        The CSS cascade algorithm's job is to select CSS declarations in order to determine the correct values for CSS
        properties. <br>
        When a same element is declared with multiple CSS declarations, then the last declaration(get priorities) will
        be applied.
    </p>
    <h2>What is Specificity?</h2>
    <p>
        Specificity is an algorithm that calculates the weight that is applied to a given CSS declaration.<br>
        When multiple declarations are applied to the same element, the declaration with the highest specificity will be
        applied. <br>
        If the specificity is the same, then the cascading order will be applied.
    </p>
    <p>
        The specificity of a CSS selector is calculated based on the following rules:<br>
        <b>!important>Inline>Id>Class>Element>Universal</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Inline styles have the highest specificity. Specificity of 1, 0, 0, 0</li>
        <li>ID selectors have a higher specificity than class selectors. Specificity of 0, 1, 0, 0</li>
        <li>Class selectors have a higher specificity than tag selectors. Specificity of 0, 0, 1, 0</li>
        <li>Element selector have higher specificity than Universal Selector. Specificity of 0, 0, 0, 1</li>
        <li>Universal selectors have a specificity of 0, 0, 0, 0.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
